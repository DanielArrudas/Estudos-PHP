# PHP-Studies

This repository is dedicated to documenting everything I’m learning about **PHP**.  
Each topic is organized into its own branch, allowing me to separate concepts and approaches clearly.

## 📚 Branches

Here’s how the repository is structured:

-   [`Procedural-PHP`](https://github.com/DanielArrudas/Estudos-PHP/tree/Procedural-PHP)  
    This branch focuses on **procedural PHP**, covering topics like variables, arrays, superglobals, file handling, and more.

-   [`OOP-PHP`](https://github.com/DanielArrudas/Estudos-PHP/tree/OOP-PHP)  
    This branch will focus on **Object-Oriented Programming** in PHP — classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and more advanced concepts.

- [`Docker`](https://github.com/DanielArrudas/Estudos-PHP/tree/Docker)  
    This branch is dedicated to learning how to use Docker to create and manage development environments for PHP applications.

-   More branches may be added in the future as I continue exploring other areas of PHP, such as frameworks, testing, or design patterns.

## 💡 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

-   Serve as a personal learning log for all PHP concepts I study.
-   Provide runnable examples and explanations in each branch.
-   Help others (and my future self) find clear and practical PHP references.
